ChemSim Critical Test Checklist
===============================

Tier 1 – Classical Dynamics
- `test_energy_conservation_tier1`: run NVE simulation with Lennard-Jones system; verify total energy drift stays within tolerance over defined timesteps.
- `test_thermostat_temperature_control`: apply thermostat to argon box; confirm measured temperature tracks target profile within error bounds.
- `test_boundary_condition_consistency`: propagate particles across periodic boundaries; ensure wrapped positions maintain momentum continuity and neighbor lists update correctly.
- `test_distance_based_bond_detection`: validate that covalent bond heuristics flag/clear bonds correctly when atom separations cross threshold limits.
- `test_ionic_charge_transfer`: confirm metal → nonmetal proximity triggers electron donation and resulting charge adjustments.
- `test_bonded_force_terms`: exercise harmonic bond/angle forces to ensure molecules relax toward equilibrium geometries without instability.
- `test_water_formation_slots`: confirm valence-slot accounting bonds two hydrogens to oxygen and satisfies octet targets.

Tier 2 – Quantum-Inspired Bonding
- `test_orbital_overlap_bonding_rules`: position diatomic species (e.g., H2, CO); confirm bond order, length, and energy match expected approximations from orbital overlap logic.
- `test_partial_charge_distribution`: evaluate polar molecule (e.g., H2O) and ensure computed partial charges align with reference data within tolerance.
- `test_reaction_energy_balance`: orchestrate bond formation/breaking scenario; verify total system energy adjusts by predicted enthalpy change.

Tier 3 – Dynamic Electrons
- `test_electron_localization_vs_field`: place electron densities near nucleus with external field; ensure localization shifts track field strength quantitatively.
- `test_ionization_threshold`: excite atom with photon input; confirm electron ejection occurs only when supplied energy exceeds ionization threshold.
- `test_gpu_cpu_consistency`: compare electron dynamics results between GPU-accelerated and CPU reference implementations for identical seeds.

Cross-Layer Validation
- `test_data_integrity_periodic_table`: audit atomic property dataset for completeness and unit consistency before simulations run.
- `test_visualization_physical_alignment`: verify rendered orbitals, density plots, and temperature gradients match underlying simulation data within defined tolerances.

Test Harness Vision
-------------------
- Testing framework: leverage `pytest` with simulation fixtures for deterministic configuration setup and teardown.
- Data-driven checks: read baseline scenarios from `tests/data/*.yaml` ensuring reproducibility and simplified expansion of edge cases.
- Performance guards: incorporate threshold tests for step throughput and GPU/CPU parity metrics to detect regressions early.
- Visualization validation: export frames to reference directories and perform image-diff or data overlay comparisons within tolerance thresholds.
- Continuous integration: schedule nightly suites for heavy electron dynamics tests, while running lightweight classical checks on every push.
